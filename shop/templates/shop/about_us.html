                    <p class="lead my-3">A shopping cart (American English) or trolley (British English), also known by
                        a variety of other names, is a wheeled cart supplied by a shop or store, especially
                        supermarkets, for use by customers inside the premises for transport of merchandise as they move
                        around the premises, while shopping, prior to heading to the checkout counter, cashiers or
                        tills. Increasing the amount of goods a shopper can collect increases the quantities they are
                        likely to purchase in a single trip, boosting store profitability.

                        In many cases customers can then also use the cart to transport their purchased goods to their
                        vehicles, but some carts are designed to prevent them from leaving either the store or the
                        designated parking area by magnetically locking the wheels. In many places in the United States,
                        Canada and the United Kingdom, customers are encouraged to leave the carts in designated areas
                        within the parking lot, and store employees will return the carts to the entrances. In some
                        areas carts are connected by locking mechanisms that require the insertion of a coin or token to
                        release an individual cart. Returning the cart to its designated area releases the coin to the
                        customer. </p>
